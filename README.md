# Nico Einsidler's Homepage

Repo for Nico Einsidler's personal homepage.

Run `hugo` with nix-shell (temporarily adding the inary to `PATH`): `nix-shell -p hugo`.

## Contents

- short intro (who am I?)
- links to the three last blog entries
- blog entries (very unfrequent)
- what I am (should be) doing now
- impossible list

## ToDos

- [ ] create a separate repo for the theme
- [ ] change projects/things that I'm proud of to a list of entries (so it isn't part of my theme)
- [ ] finish writing first blog post
