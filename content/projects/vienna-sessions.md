[Vienna Sessions](youtube.com/viennasessions) is a hobby project, with which Max Schöberl and I are giving young musicians a digital stage. The project aims to deliver great professional sound ready to be listened by fans on a daily basis while featuring visually interesting scenes – despite its name – not only in Vienna, Austria.

Our rules for creating those music session videos are simple:

- We do not cut in between takes, so it's **always a single take**. But of course several takes may be recorded.
- We do not take money to create those session, so being in featured in **a session is free**. Although we have engaged in contract work, Vienna Sessions should remain accessible to all andfun always comes first.
- **We pick an artist** from our session request database. We cannot record everyone, but we do try to not favor a certain genre.

So if you are making music and want to record a session with us, please [sign up in our artist database](https://goo.gl/forms/XWlc6YJIpYl2eb9F2).
