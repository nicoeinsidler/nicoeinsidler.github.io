UniPocket was an app for students to capture the social aspect of studying. It included many different features and could be described as a "super app" (which may have been its biggest flaw):

- book marketplace
- match making (for learn buddies, parties, dating, learning new languages via the tandem program, etc.)
- sECTS (social ECTS)
- daily lunch menus
- university & campus news
- news bombs: people could drop so-called "news bombs" (messages to other users) and set an explosion radius, if other UniPocket users would cross that time-space area they get a push notification containing the message
- chat between students
- find my friends at university ("friend radar" on campus)
- events (and who's attending)
- useful information for students
