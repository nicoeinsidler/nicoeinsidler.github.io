UniPocket was an app for students to capture the social aspect of studying. It included many different features and could be described as a "super app" (which may have been its biggest flaw):

And we implemented even more features, which unfortunately I don't have screenshots of:

- match making (for learn buddies, parties, dating, learning new languages via the tandem program, etc.)
- sECTS (social ECTS)
- news bombs: people could drop so-called "news bombs" (messages to other users) and set an explosion radius, if other UniPocket users would cross that time-space area they get a push notification containing the message

Close before launch day, we started a guerilla marketing campaign in Vienna. But we didn't launch only in Austria – no, that would have been way to easy – we launched globally.
