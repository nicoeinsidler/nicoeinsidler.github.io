Hi, my name is Nico Einsidler. I work at the intersection of [science](#science), [engineering](#engineering) and [design](#design) to help solve humanities biggest problems.

{{< pAnchor id="science">}}I am pursuing my masters in technical physics at [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/), where I specialized in neutron and quantum physics. I got the chance to work with amazing people at nuclear reactors in Grenoble & Vienna and [co-authored a paper](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.023175) with them.{{< /pAnchor >}}

{{< pAnchor id="design">}} While studying I worked as a freelance web designer and developer.{{< /pAnchor >}}

{{< pAnchor id="engineering">}}Over the years I co-founded three startups, WU Campus Men√ºs, UniPocket and Freilich Open Arts, which was later rebranded as [littlebig.art](https://www.littlebig.art/). Since 2020 I am now crafting for [IBM](https://ibm.at/), where I work on the future of computing. I am helping clients run, maintain and automate on the worlds most efficient computing platform, IBM Z and preparing them for the next computing paradigm, quantum computing with IBM Quantum.{{< /pAnchor >}}
